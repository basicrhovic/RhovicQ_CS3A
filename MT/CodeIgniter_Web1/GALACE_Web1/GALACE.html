    <p><h3>Top Jobs to take:</h3>
        <dl>
            <dt>Web Designer: </dt>
            <dd>After Graduate, I want to be web designer so I can apply my skills when it comes to designing. I also think that this is my advantage among the others because growing up I really find enhancing images, color palette, aesthetic interesting. And I also enjoy adding some elements that will make the system more pleasing to the eyes. <br></dd>

            <dt>Interior Design: </dt>
            <dd>This is my first choice, but for some reason this course is not present on the school I am attending to. However, this is something similar with the course I am taking right now. Because as I said I always find designing interesting.<br></dd>

            <dt>Fine Arts Major in Film Industry: </dt>
            <dd>Aside from being a designer, Photography is a skill that I think I developed since I was in high school. I even join a club that nurture me in photography. Snapping some beautiful moments is something I really like since then, and make the moment into memories that I will surely look back in the near future.<br></dd>
