                <h2>Chapters of My Autobiography</h2>
                <h3>Chapter 1: Coexistence </h3>
                <p>A resilient, ambitious, and a son with a bright attitude are one of those things when a mother dreams 
her son wants him to become when he grows up. For her to remember it every time she looks at him, she 
named her second child, Rhovic James after his last name Queddeng. Yes, it was me — I am the youngest 
child of my father, Mario Robert L. Queddeng and my mother, Sonia G. Queddeng, who again brought faith 
and strength to their life the moment I was born on the 28th day of February, year 2004 at Sta. Lucia Hospital 
now the Ilocos Sur District Hospital - Sta Lucia. I also have a sister, my Ate named Roshine Joy G. 
Queddeng. We are a small family who lived together happily at Caterman, Candon City, Ilocos Sur. As years 
pass by, we face challenges and problems together, we bond and love each other. My parents have always 
been very supportive and guide us on everything we do. Despite having a busy schedule at their work, my 
mother as a saleslady and my father as an electrician, they never let us feel unloved and left alone. </p>

                <h3>Chapter 2: Embers</h3>
                <p>However, growing up, I couldn't always be by my parents’ side forever, I also had to step out of my 
comfort zone, face reality, and explore new things. So, at the age of 5, my parents decided that I should start 
school already. My mother enrolled me in Caterman Day Care Center as a kindergarten student. Compared 
to other typical preschoolers, one of what I am proud of myself is that I go to school without someone 
accompanying me. My parents just drop me off every day at school before going to work, and let me discover 
myself on my own, and that's what I thank them for. Their absence has never been an issue for me, as they 
have always been there whenever I need them, they taught me good manners and supported me in 
everything I do. Rather, it taught me how to be independent, explore who I am, and meet new friends. During 
my kindergarten days, I discovered here my interest in drawing which became one of my passions. I ended 
my kindergarten days with a smile on my face, ribbons pinned on my toga as a symbolism of my braveness 
and being an independent at a young age.</p>

                <h3>Chapter 3: Ethereal Ties</h3>
                <p>Then, after kindergarten, I continued my education at Caterman Elementary School Annex now the 
Felomeno Elementary School, where I discovered myself more and made new friends again. I developed a 
curiosity for technologies when I received a smartphone as gift from my parents early on. I was also enrolled 
in computer classes at Candon Public Market every Saturday through our school's collaboration program, 
which boost my curiosity about advancing technology. I also discovered my interest in drawing, so, when I 
was in grade 4, I joined campus journalism and became editorial cartoonist, joined boy scouts that I really 
enjoyed, and competed in various competitions such as Milo Olympics held in Baguio City. But then, as my 
5th grade in elementary was coming to its end, an unexpected event that challenged me came. My parents 
have separated. This was the most painful event in my life that I have experienced, although it is difficult to 
accept, I can't do anything but face the reality. I grew up with a happy and united family, but in an instant, it 
was torn apart. However, despite having a broken heart, I still continued my normal life with my mother and 
sister who were left by my side. They have become my inspiration to do better in my studies and focus on my 
dreams. I became more active in school, I got to know myself better, and I became mature in life. Although 
my family was not complete, it did not stop me from pursuing my dreams, and as a result of my 
perseverance, I finished elementary school, being resilient and ambitious.</p>

                <h3>Chapter 4: Resurgence</h3>
                <p>As my mother want me to experience a new environment. My mother enrolled me at Nicosat Colleges 
to join my Ate and to continue my education as a high school student. Everything is going well, I started my 
Grade 7 journey with new friends, deepening my interest in technology by spending most of my free time in 
the computer lab. I really enjoyed my high school life one curiosity at a time, I also joined a pageant out of 
curiosity on Valentine's Day and won the title of Mr. Valentine's, standing out among my competitors. But 
before I graduate from Junior High School, lockdown came, due to the pandemic caused by the COVID 19, 
we were not able to march on our graduation and only having an online graduation. Then as were having 
pandemic I was transferred to Candon City National High School to continue senior high school and I 
decided to take Accountancy, Business, and Management as my strand in Senior High School following my 
Ate that also took Accountancy, Business, and Management, My Ate’s guidance was invaluable, especially 
as we’re on distant learning via modules only. Having her as a mentor during lockdown was a significant 
advantage. Nevertheless, despite the pandemic I still have ended my Senior High School loud and proud as 
a way to honor my mother who single-handedly supported Me and my Ate.</p>

                <h3>Chapter 5: Zenith</h3>
                <p>Then came my final stage of education — college level. In order to achieve my dream, I enrolled at 
North Luzon Polytechnic State College back then, Ilocos Sur Polytechnic State College – Main Campus now 
and soon will be University Ilocos Philippines, for a Bachelor of Science in Criminology, as mostly of my Tito 
are serving in the Military and as a Police Officer that encouraged me to join them. Unfortunately, I was not 
accepted due limited slots only, however, I seek for another course, and prayed to God, took some advice 
from my family, then Bachelor of Science in Computer Science was introduced to me, I was told that if I took 
this course I will be qualified for Special Enlistment in the Philippine Army, and have a fair advantage in 
various fields for this taking this course, due to its high demand. So, no second thoughts I enrolled in 
Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, and during my college years, I have been involved in the 
Advanced ROTC program, participated in Philippine Red Cross blood donation drives, and serving as the 
Internal Vice President of our Class. Additionally, I have taken part in workshop training programs, such as 
Uplift Code Camp and Village 88 Inc., to further enhance my knowledge in coding and software 
development. And also, to lessen the financial burden on my mother, I sought part-time employment in 
construction and got employed as an admin at ELY’s Journey Construction, to help cover mostly of my 
weekly allowances, especially on my studies like providing myself some equipment to use, but my job is for 
part time only and there’s no guarantee I can still work during the following semester of my college years, 
and this allowed my mother to focus on supporting my Ate with her academic needs. Each of these 
experiences has contributed to my growth, both academically and personally, shaping my well-rounded 
approach to education. Looking ahead, my career aspirations are centered around leveraging technology to 
create meaningful solutions that address real-world problems. I am particularly interested in pursuing a 
career in software development, with a specific focus on emerging fields such as artificial intelligence and 
cybersecurity. I believe that these areas hold great potential for innovation and impact, and I am eager to 
contribute to advancements that can improve lives and enhance security. I've been working hard to stay 
academically focused, not to mention balancing a part-time job.</p>

                <h3>Chapter 6: Eon</h3>
                <p>And now, I have reached my 3rd year in Bachelor of Science in Computer Science happily and 
without any regret. I have become really motivated on working hard to improve myself, perfecting my skills, 
and preparing for our approaching internship and theses in our 4th year, in order to achieve my ultimate goal 
of being a software developer, as I realized, in my 3 years in computer science, it may not be one of my 
plans and what I was expecting. I remember thinking about where I would be back then, dreaming, and now 
here I am, CHASING DREAMS.</p>

                <h3>Bonus Chapter: Partner in Crime</h3>
                <p>I met my partner in crime early on our first year of college, I’ve never expecting him to become my 
most trusted and only best friend. Let’s call him Paeng. During my early college days, finding someone to 
truly connect with was difficult not until I’ve met Paeng. My first impression of Paeng? He seemed like an 
innocent and decent student, serious and disciplined. But as our friendship grow by, I realized there was so 
much more to him. Paeng was a jack of all trades, someone who could simple do almost anything. Without a 
doubt, he had no dark side because I can see his bright deep inside just pure talent and intelligence. 
Especially when it comes to academics, Paeng always led the way, mentoring me sharing his incredible 
skills. He was extraordinary at programming that always make me wonder, making complex problems look 
effortless. His math skills were out of the ordinary easily solving equations faster than anyone I know. But 
what truly set him apart was his overthinking skills, which some might see as a flaw, but not for Paeng. His 
ability to think ahead, to foresee possible outcomes, made him a strategic and visionary thinker. I feel 
incredibly blessed to have met someone like Paeng. Together, we embarked on countless adventures, 
especially when we went in Baguio, where we roamed like carefree souls, living in the moment, free from 
worries. Alongside our dear friend Bernadette, our inner circle of three became my greatest support system. 
And our adventure began, more than just adventure buddies, they became my food buddies too. Whether it 
was street food, fast food, or searching for the best local delicacies, we always made time to eat together. It 
was fun trying out new things, discovering hidden food spots, and turning every meal into a moment to 
cherish. Food became more than just a necessity it became a bond that brought us even closer. But our 
bond didn’t stop there. We were also gaming buddies we’re teammates in both real life and in-game 
overcoming every challenges. Whether it was intense battles in Mobile Legends, PUBG, or other games, we 
fought side by side, strategizing, laughing, and celebrating every victory (or raging over defeats). It was fun 
playing late into the night, testing our skills, and forming unbreakable teamwork. Gaming became another 
escape, a world where we could be fearless warriors, brilliant tacticians, and unstoppable champions, all 
while strengthening our friendship in the process. Surviving college wouldn’t have been possible without 
them. They weren’t just friends, they were FAMILY.</p>
